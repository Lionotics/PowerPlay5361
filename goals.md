# Overall software team goals / tasks

## 5361:

### Auto  
- [x] Vision implementation:
  - **Skill level:** Medium
  - **What it includes:** Using Opencv, be able to detect three distinct printed targets on a cone
  - **Status:** Done! Shoutout to Daniel.

- [ ] General drivetrain tuning
  - **Skill level:** Hard, just because it's new
  - **What it includes:** Tuning roadrunner for auto, depending on timing either with dead wheels or motor encoders 
  - **Status:** Done with drive encoders for current robot configuration
- [ ] Basic non-cycle auto
  - **Skill level:** Hard, just because it's new
  - **What it includes:** An autonomous opmode to place the preload and park in the correct location, should be done for both sides!
  - **Status:** Not started
- [ ] Cycle auto
  - **Skill level:** Hard, because it's new, and it's generally not super easy to do right
  - **What it includes:** An autonomous opmode to place the preload and get more from the stack, placing them, before park in the correct location, should be done for both sides!
  - **Status:** Not started

### Teleop
- [x] Config written
  - **Skill level:** Easy
  - **What it includes:** Figure out what motor is plugged in where, and put that in the config; save the config to the repo.
  - **Requirements to get it done:** Hardware built
  - **Status:** As done as it can be for now
- [x] Basic Chassis controls - Driver and non driver oriented
  - **Skill level:** Fairly simple
  - **What it includes:** Setup of the drive motors and imu, and then reusing the driver oriented code from last year
  - **Requirements to get it done:** chassis needs to be built and wired.
  - **Status:** Done!
- [ ] Basic configuration / control for all "manipulation" hardware
  - **Skill level:**  Easy
  - **What it includes:** add basic manual controls for all the motors
  - **Requirements to get it done:** Hardware needs to be built and ready for testing
  - **Status:** Somewhat completed, waiting on hardware.
- [ ] Automation + Driver assists (encoders, LEDs, etc.) for ^ 
  - **Skill level:** Easy to Medium
  - **What it includes:** Adding and configuring sensors so that drivers can have an easier time and do less work
  - **Status:** Not started
